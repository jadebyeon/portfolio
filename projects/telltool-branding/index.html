          TELL Tool: Designing a Visual Identity for Inclusive Family Communication
        </h1>
        <p class="project__lede">
          The TELL Tool (Talking to Children about Donor Conception) is a University of Michigan
          research initiative that empowers parents, clinicians, and researchers to foster open,
          compassionate conversations with children about their donor origins. Led by Dr. Patricia
          Hershberger, the project merges scientific rigor with emotional support, targeting a
          diverse user base—including single parents, LGBTQ+ families, multicultural households,
          and healthcare professionals.

          As the designer, my goal was to translate this mission into a flexible, inclusive, and emotionally resonant brand identity that establishes trust while remaining adaptable across print, digital, and physical environments.
        </p>

        <h3>Design Problem</h3>
        <p>
          How can a brand system foster trust and inclusivity without reinforcing any single family structure or alienating non-traditional users? Given the sensitive nature of donor conception and the TELL Tool’s wide-ranging audience, the brand had to convey scientific credibility and emotional warmth without appearing clinical, exclusive, or overly sentimental. It also needed to function seamlessly across settings—from clinical conference posters to social media content and tote bags.
        </p>

        <h3>Research &amp; Strategy</h3>
        <p>
          My process began with research into the lived experiences of the TELL Tool’s audience: parents navigating complex emotional disclosures, children of different developmental stages, and researchers with clinical standards. This led to three guiding principles:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Professional but not sterile</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Warm but not childish</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Inclusive but specific</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          From these insights, I focused on symbolic forms (rather than human figures) to represent connection, biology, and love—avoiding any iconography that might unintentionally suggest a narrow idea of family.
        </p>

        <h3>Visual System Development</h3>
        <p>
          I developed the logo by merging a DNA double helix with a heart, abstracted through geometric curves and negative space. The result is a symbol that suggests both biological origins and emotional bonds, while remaining gender- and family-structure-neutral.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Typography:</strong> Futura for a modern, clear, humanist tone across platforms.</li>
          <li><strong>Color Palette:</strong> Soft blues/greys for trust; accents in green/lavender for warmth and flexibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Layouts:</strong> Vertical/horizontal logo configurations with careful scaling and spacing for legibility and cross-platform adaptability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Logo variations (standard, reversed, color-background)</li>
          <li>Color palette and type hierarchy</li>
          <li>Stationery suite (letterhead, envelope, business cards by role)</li>
          <li>Conference signage (registration, wayfinding, info wall with DNA motif)</li>
          <li>Social media &amp; website templates</li>
          <li>Merchandise (tote, tees, umbrella, bottle)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>
          The identity was praised for flexibility, cross-cultural sensitivity, and clarity. It set a scalable foundation for multilingual adaptations and future expansion into mobile, social, and academic spaces.
        </p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          This was my first large-scale, identity-driven client project. I learned the strategic weight of logo systems and color decisions across accessibility and media. Next time I’ll invest more in mark exploration/testing and color accessibility. The experience strengthened my ability to manage complexity, collaborate with researchers, and build an identity rooted in empathy and clarity.
