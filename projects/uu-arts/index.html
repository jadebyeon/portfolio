          As the Arts Initiative Coordinator at the University of Michigan, I designed an integrated system to 
          help student artists, staff curators, and community partners understand where, how, and when to exhibit 
          work across the Michigan Union, League, and Pierpont Commons. The work connected digital infrastructure 
          (web, forms) with physical space planning and institutional workflows to improve clarity, accessibility, 
          and institutional memory.

    <!-- Design Problem -->

        <h3>Design Problem</h3>
        <p>
          University Unions offered a variety of gallery and display spaces for student and faculty artwork, 
          but there was no centralized digital infrastructure for artists to understand where, how, and when 
          they could exhibit. The submission process was fragmented, space details were not visible online, 
          and institutional coordination (e.g., contracts, installation workflows) lacked clear documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I set out to design a system that improves human–computer interaction across multiple user types 
          (student artists, staff curators, and community partners) by building tools that enable clarity,
          accessibility, and organizational continuity.

        <h3>Research &amp; Strategy</h3>
        <p>To frame the design approach, I led a multi-method research phase that included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Heuristic evaluation of the existing submission form and Unions web structure</li>
          <li>Ongoing stakeholder check-ins with Senior Associate Directors and Program Staffs to understand institutional goals and constraints</li>
          <li>On-site display audits of the buildings to document logistics</li>
          <li>Comparative analysis of peer institution galleries for structural and UX benchmarks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These insights revealed three strategic priorities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clarify</strong> submission flows through role-specific guidance</li>
          <li><strong>Visualize</strong> physical spaces to improve pre-installation planning and decision making</li>
          <li><strong>Systematize</strong> documentation, signage, and rotation strategy</li>

        <h3>System Development</h3>

        <h4>Webpage &amp; Submission System</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Prototyped a dedicated “Arts at the Unions” webpage for the <em>uunions.umich.edu</em> site, aligned with the university's information architecture</li>
          <li>Iterated three versions of two key sections, conducted a stakeholder survey to collect design preferences, and finalized the layout based on results</li>
          <li>Presented the final prototype in a formal stakeholder proposal, including layout logic, user roles, and implementation notes</li>
          <li>Rebuilt the submission form with conditional logic separating internal and external users, improving clarity and administrative efficiency</li>
          <li>Refined copy and flow to match institutional tone and accessibility standards</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Display Strategy &amp; Mapping</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Created site-specific visual maps of art spaces, annotated with size, lighting, and usage conditions</li>
          <li>Proposed modular signage and rotation strategy for recurring programs (e.g., BHM, Women’s History Month)</li>
          <li>Archived past installations with photo documentation to support future curation and records</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Workflow Infrastructure</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Coordinated department-specific SignNow setup for digital art loan agreements</li>
          <li>Assisted in live exhibition installs</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Reflection -->

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Designing for engagement in institutional environments often requires more than user-friendly interfaces — it demands system-level thinking that connects digital tools to physical space, administrative processes, and organizational culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          One area I would improve next time is stakeholder onboarding earlier in the design process. Because the initiative was relatively new, ideas like webpage integration or signage redesign required more rounds of clarification and alignment than anticipated. In the future, I would run co-design workshops and add structured feedback checkpoints earlier so that marketing, facilities, and programming partners can co-shape and own the system from the outset.
        </p>
        <p>
          This experience reinforced that scalable systems — even for something as analog as a gallery wall — have cross-context value. Process mapping, conditional logic for form flows, and visual documentation readily translate to community archives, nonprofit event workflows, or digital public-engagement tools. I now feel more equipped to build infrastructure that enables creative and operational clarity across users, teams, and environments.
